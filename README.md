## What is this repo all about?

The repo is made up of Shell and PowerShell Scripts used in my CodeFellows Cyber Ops Bootcamp during March - May of 2023.

## Why am I learning these skills?

I am learning these skills to make me a better Cybersecurity engineer.

## Fundamental concepts I learned in Ops 201 include: 

Technical Service & Support
* Customer service
* Endpoint technical support
* Issue tracking system
* ITIL service management framework
* Knowledge management, documentation, and standard operating procedures (SOP)
* Remote desktop support and diagnostics
* Service level agreement (SLA)
* Technical project support
* Technical reporting and communication
* Troubleshooting methodology

Hardware & Software
* Endpoint imaging, backup, and recovery
* Windows 10 troubleshooting and configuration
* Performance monitoring and tuning
* Software application deployment, updating, and removal

Infrastructure connectivity
* Active Directory user support
* Cloud instance deployment
* Network protocols TCP/IP, DHCP, DNS, LAN, SMTP, WAN, VPN
* Network ports, ethernet
* Network troubleshooting
* Network routers


## What was my favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?

The domain.sh was my favorite because its one that I utilize more often than others.

## Here are some examples of how shell scripting can be applied to the workplace:

* Automating tasks: Shell scripts can be used to automate repetitive tasks, such as backing up files, sending emails, or updating software. This can save time and improve productivity.
* Monitoring systems: Shell scripts can be used to monitor systems for problems, such as disk space usage, CPU usage, and network traffic. This can help to identify and fix problems before they cause outages or data loss.
* Deploying applications: Shell scripts can be used to deploy applications to servers. This can save time and ensure that applications are deployed consistently.
* Testing applications: Shell scripts can be used to test applications. This can help to identify and fix bugs before they are released to users.
* Generating reports: Shell scripts can be used to generate reports from data. This can help to make data more accessible and easier to understand.

## What scripts would I continue to improve if I had the time?

The domains.sh

## What aspects of my shell scripting skillset do I hope to improve next?

I look forward to coming up with ways to improve efficiency.
